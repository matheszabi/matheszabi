### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some PUBLIC source code.

Mostly proof of concepts or job assignments. Some are from 2013-2015.


https://github.com/matheszabi/nature_images_flutterhttps://github.com/matheszabi/nature_images_flutter

has a working splash screen, not just a 1x1 pixel image stretched to full screen, but a full size image.
has application icons ( generated with a library, which is removed, because it is a one-time use tool).
has a loading screen (with 3 color gradients) and a status message about what is doing right now.
the loading screen when it finishes and it will go to home screen, it will remove the possibility to come back to this screen (Android press the Back button)
It will do an HTTP GET and it will receive a JSON and it will parse it to "model" objects. Plain Old Dart Objects (podo).
It will load the thumbnails (smaller images) and it will build a list.
with Prev and Next it implemented the infinite scrolling list.
Clicking on the list it shows the details of the element (another info which is a bigger, scrollable image).
